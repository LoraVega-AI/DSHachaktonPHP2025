A loud, unmuffled engine noise was detected, which sounds like a car or truck engine running without a muffler. This is likely caused by a vehicle or machinery that is not properly maintained or is being used in a way that is not safe. The noise is persistent and could be a sign of a problem that needs attention.\r\n   Classification: A loud, unmuffled engine noise was detected, which sounds like a car or truck engine running without a muffler. This is likely caused by a vehicle or machinery that is not properly maintained or is being used in a way that is not safe. The noise is persistent and could be a sign of a problem that needs attention.\r\n   Recommended Action: The noise should be investigated to find the source and make sure it\'s not causing any harm.

It\'s not immediately dangerous, but it could be causing damage or disturbing people. The risk level is medium because it\'s not a critical problem, but it still needs to be investigated and fixed.\r\n\r\nRecommended Action Steps:\r\n  1. 1. Find the source of the noise to determine what\'s causing it.\r\n  2. 2. Check the vehicle or machinery to make sure it\'s working properly and not causing any damage.\r\n  3. 3.
